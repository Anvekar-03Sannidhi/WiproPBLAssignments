# Given a string and an integer n, return a string made of n repetitions of the last n characters
# of the string. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string inclusive.
# For example if the inputs are "Wipro" and 3, then the output should be "propropro".

text = "Wipro"
n = 3
result = text[-n:] * n
print(result)
